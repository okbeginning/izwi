Have local conversations with chat models running on your own machine.

## Overview

Izwi chat provides:

- **Local inference** — Model execution stays on-device
- **Multiple model families** — Qwen3, Qwen3.5, Qwen3.8, LFM2.5, and Gemma
- **System prompts** — Shape assistant behavior
- **Streaming output** — Incremental response tokens
- **Multimodal support (Qwen3.5 only)** — Image inputs in chat API requests

---

## Getting Started

### Download a Chat Model

```bash
izwi pull Qwen3-8B-GGUF
```

### Start Chatting

```bash
izwi chat --model Qwen3-8B-GGUF
```

Web UI:

```
http://localhost:8080/chat
```

---

## Using the CLI

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--model`, `-m` | Chat model to use | `qwen3-0.6b-4bit` |
| `--system`, `-s` | System prompt | — |
| `--voice`, `-v` | Voice for spoken responses | — |

`qwen3-0.6b-4bit` remains the CLI default for backward compatibility.
For new setups, prefer an enabled model from `izwi list`, such as `Qwen3-8B-GGUF` or `Qwen3.5-4B`.

Examples:

```bash
izwi chat --system "You are a helpful coding assistant."
izwi chat --model Qwen3-8B-GGUF
izwi chat --model Qwen3.5-4B
izwi chat --model LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF
izwi chat --model Gemma-3-1b-it
```

---

## Using the Web UI

1. Open **Chat** in the sidebar
2. Enter a prompt
3. Send and review streamed output
4. Switch loaded models from the model selector

---

## Using the API

### Text Chat Endpoint

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
```

### Text Request Example

```json
{
  "model": "Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this project in three bullets."}
  ],
  "stream": true
}
```

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Multimodal (Image) Example

Image inputs are supported only on Qwen3.5 GGUF chat variants:

```json
{
  "model": "Qwen3.5-4B",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "input_text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
        {"type": "input_image", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/cat.png"}}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The API also supports SSE streaming, `stream_options.include_usage`, tool-call
payloads, and strict/relaxed OpenAI compatibility profiles. See the
[API Reference](/api#chat-completions) for the full request contract and
streaming sequence.

## Supported Chat Models

| Family | Models |
|--------|--------|
| Qwen3 | `Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF`, `Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF`, `Qwen3-4B-GGUF`, `Qwen3-8B-GGUF` |
| Qwen3.5 | `Qwen3.5-0.8B`, `Qwen3.5-2B`, `Qwen3.5-4B`, `Qwen3.5-9B` |
| Qwen3.8 FP8 | `Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` (text only) |
| LFM2.5 | `LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF`, `LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking-GGUF` |
| Gemma | `Gemma-3-1b-it` |

Qwen3.8 is registered as its own `Qwen38Chat` runtime family. It does not
inherit Qwen3.5 backend certification, state-conformance evidence, or media
capabilities. Its CUDA deployment uses a
[scale-aware Q8_0 compressed fallback](/support-matrix#qwen38-cuda-weight-residency),
not native FP8 execution.

---

## Multimodal Limits

- Multimodal media chat is currently limited to **Qwen3.5 GGUF** models.
- **Video inputs are not yet implemented**.
- Non-Qwen3.5 chat variants, including `Qwen3.8-27B-FP8`, currently support text-only requests.

---

## Tips

1. Use `izwi list` to pick a currently enabled model ID.
2. Use stronger models (`Qwen3-8B-GGUF`, `Qwen3.5-9B`, `Qwen3.8-27B-FP8`) for harder tasks when the host has sufficient memory; check the [Qwen3.8 CUDA residency requirements](/support-matrix#qwen38-cuda-weight-residency) before deploying the 27B checkpoint.
3. Use smaller models (`Qwen3.5-0.8B`, `LFM2.5-1.2B-*`) for low-latency usage.

## CUDA concurrent chat

Qwen3.8 batches independent CUDA chat requests through one loaded model by default.
The incremental admission policy grows cache reservations with active sequences
and can suspend and replay a request when the shared cache is under pressure. It preserves automatic
output limits and already streamed text. Capacity is derived from the device's
memory and model state, rather than a GPU model name.

Use your normal CUDA server command; no environment flag is needed. The policy
also enables scheduler-visible chunked prefill for resumable adapters. To opt out
and return to conservative admission, set this before restarting the server:

```bash
export IZWI_CUDA_INCREMENTAL_CHAT=0
```

Set it to `1` or remove the variable to restore the default.
Other model families keep their existing admission policy until they implement the
published-sequence replay contract.

Use separate conversations, or independent `/v1/chat/completions` requests, for
concurrent answers. Sends to the same conversation remain ordered. The playground
allows one active stream per mounted view; separate tabs can use separate conversations.

Inspect `/v1/health` for the effective `runtime.chat_concurrency_policy`, and
`/v1/metrics` for actual model batch widths, cache claims, suspensions and replay
work. Open HTTP streams alone do not establish concurrent model execution. Heavy
cache pressure can still queue or suspend requests; simultaneous maximum-length
histories must fit the available state budget.

Temporary batch workspace pressure is also handled before model execution: the
scheduler reduces batch width or resumable prefill size and retries the same
request without repeating streamed output. Under persistent pressure it can
suspend eligible Qwen3.8 requests. Progress from competing work keeps waiting
requests eligible; repeated failures with no progress still return an explicit
capacity error. Requests that cannot fit alone cannot be guaranteed to finish.
Capacity diagnostics group pending reservations by owner class to distinguish
model, request, and workspace promises from materialized memory.

For a controlled hardware acceptance run, use
`scripts/bench/run-cuda-chat-concurrency.py` as documented in
`scripts/bench/README.md`. It checks uncapped requests through both API routes,
staggered arrivals, cancellation, overlapping output, actual multirow forwards,
and resource release. CPU tests do not certify CUDA throughput or numerical behavior.
